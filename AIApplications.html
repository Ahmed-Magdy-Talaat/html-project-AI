            Examples of artificial intelligence (AI) in pop culture usually involve a pack of intelligent robots hell-bent on overthrowing the human race, or at least a fancy theme park. Sentient machines with general artificial intelligence don't yet exist, and they likely won't exist anytime soon, so we're safe... for now. 

            That's not to make light of AI's potential impact on our future. In a recent survey, more than 72% of Americans expressed worry about a future in which machines perform many human jobs. Additionally, tech billionaire Elon Musk, long an advocate for the regulation of artificial intelligence, recently called AI more dangerous than nukes. Despite these legitimate concerns, we're a long way from living in Westworld.

         <h2>ROBOTICS</h2>
Industry leaders still can’t agree on what the term “robot” embodies. Roboticists understand robots to be programmable machines that carry out tasks, but nobody can pinpoint exactly where that definition ends.

Today's AI-powered robots, or at least those machines deemed as such, possess no natural general intelligence, but they are capable of solving problems and "thinking" in a limited capacity.

From working on assembly lines at Tesla to teaching Japanese students English, examples of artificial intelligence in the field of robotics are plentiful

<h2>SELF-DRIVING CARS</h2>
Self-driving cars are the ultimate sign that the future is upon us. Once considered science fiction, self-driving technology is slowly inching its way towards a driverless reality. In fact, it’s expected that more than 33 million autonomous vehicles will be hitting the road by 2040. We can thank AI for the breakthroughs we’re seeing in a truly futuristic technology.

Artificial intelligence is literally driving the future of the self-driving car industry. These cars are loaded with sensors that are constantly taking note of everything going on around the car and using AI to make the correct adjustments. These sensors capture thousands of data points every millisecond (like car speed, road conditions, pedestrian whereabouts, other traffic, etc.), and use AI to help interpret the data and act accordingly- all in a blink-of-an-eye. We may still have a long way to go until we’re fully capable of driving autonomously, but these companies below and paving the way towards an autonomous driving future.

<h2>FINANCE</h2>
AI and the finance industry are a match made in heaven. The financial sector relies on accuracy, real-time reporting and processing high volumes of quantitative data to make decisions, all areas intelligent machines excel in.

As the industry takes note of AI's efficiency and accuracy, it is rapidly implementing automation, chatbots, adaptive intelligence, algorithmic trading and machine learning into financial processes.   

One of the biggest financial trends of 2018 is the robo-advisor, an automated portfolio manager.

These automated advisors use AI and algorithms to scan data in the markets and predict the best stock or portfolio based on preferences. Wealth management firms are turning towards robo-advisors, not only because it saves both the company and client time and money, but it also produces some extraordinary returns.

Here are a few examples of how artificial intelligence is changing the financial industry.

Numerai
<h2>NUMERAI: AN AI-POWERED, CROWDSOURCED HEDGE FUND</h2> 
Industry: Hedge Fund, Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain

Location: San Francisco

How it's using AI: Numerai is an AI-powered hedge fund using crowdsourced machine learning from thousands of data scientists around the world.

The company releases abstracted financial data to its community of data scientists, all of whom are using different machine learning models to predict the stock market.

The models are pitted against one another in a weekly tournament where creators compete for Numeraire (NMR), the company's cryptocurrency. The most accurate predictions make it to the top of the leaderboard and are awarded more tokens.  

But Numerai isn't really about rewarding winners and losers.  The competition is simply a way to collect more models. The company's real breakthrough is in how it synthesizes all of the varying approaches into a "Meta Model."

The diversity of the models within the "Meta Model" creates diversity in the portfolio, reducing risk and generating higher returns. Simply put, the more algorithms at work, the better. 

Industry impact The company is top secret about the makeup of the fund, its clients and performance, but has more than 35,000 data scientists contributing to its platform and has paid out some $15 million worth of its cryptocurrency.
